Note:
- Please note that the commit history shows various contributors because 1. We used our own machines and the CS Department's ugrad machines to make git commits; 2. One of our members (Joon Hyuck Choi) needed to borrow his friend's computer for a while because his computer did not work for a period of time. The owner of that computer is NOT taking 600.475 this semester.
