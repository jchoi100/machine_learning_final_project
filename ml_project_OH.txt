1. Can we use the dataset from class?
    -> If not, where can we get some good data?

2. Have an idea to work with different variants of KNN

    1. Locally Adaptive KNN
    2. Weight Adjusted KNN
    3. Adaptive KNN
    4. KNN with Shared Nearest Neighbors
    5. KNN with K-Menas
    6. Generalized KNN
    7. Informative KNN
    8. Bayesian KNN
    9. SVM KNN
    10. Density Based KNN 
    11. Variable KNN
    12. Class Based KNN
    13. Discernibility KNN

    --> Implement x of them by ourselves and compare
        accuracy and running times of these algorithms.
        (Including the two we implemented for homework.)

    --> Anything else we can add on to this?

    Good idea?

3. How many of those should we implement?

4.
