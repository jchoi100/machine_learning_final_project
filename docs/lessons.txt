For reduced dataset,
1. For small values of K, standard KNN worked well.

2. But for SVM-KNN, small values of K showed poor results.
   With greater K values, when there was a diagreement
   amongst the votes (i.e. unanimous voting failed), the
   SVM was able to catch mistakes that the standard KNN
   would have made anyway. For instance, if the true label
   was supposed to be 8 but the votes said that 4 was most
   likely, SVM outputted 8 nonetheless.
